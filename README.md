## **Forecasting Wholesale energy prices with Facebook Prophet**

**In a prolonged period of fluctuating energy prices, who knows what wholesale energy prices will be in the future?**

...hopefully us...

From households to industries, energy plays a pivotal role in our daily lives and economic sustainability. Predicting energy prices is not just a technical exercise; it's a mission-critical endeavour for policymakers, businesses, and individuals who depend on an efficient and cost-effective energy supply.

In this project, I set out to unlock the secrets hidden within the data and provide insights that can empower better decision-making. Our primary objective is to create a robust model capable of forecasting wholesale energy prices in Spain for the next 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.

## **The Challenge Ahead**

The energy market is a dynamic ecosystem influenced by a multitude of factors, including weather patterns, oil and gas prices, currency markets, and more. Navigating this complexity is both a challenge and an opportunity. By harnessing the power of data and predictive analytics, we aim to unveil patterns, trends, and correlations that can shed light on the future of energy prices in Spain.

**Introducing Facebook Prophet:**Â In our challenge to predict energy prices, we'll be harnessing the forecasting capabilities of the Facebook Prophet model. Prophet is a powerful time series forecasting tool that can capture daily seasonality, holiday effects, and other intricacies in your data. It should prove a simple yet powerful tool.

The project will encompass several key steps:

- Data collection: Gathering historical energy price data and relevant features.
- Data preprocessing: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data for analysis.
- Feature engineering: Selecting and creating relevant features for our predictive model.
- Model selection and training: Leveraging the predictive prowess of Facebook Prophet.
- Evaluation and interpretation: Assessing the model's performance and deriving actionable insights.
